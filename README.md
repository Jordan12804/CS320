How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
The best apporach to ensure code and software are securte and functionable is by utilzing multiple methods of testing, and comparing the software to system requirments whenever possible. The more we test the more sound our code will be. And by reviewing software requirments side by side with our program will ensure we check off every goal and have built a diverse and compelling program.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
The best way to approach and incorporate user needs and requirments is by understanding the need for them. In better words by analyzing the need for these needs can help us better understand their significance within the program and will help us ensure they are the core and that the software is built around the needs and requiorments to be an impactiful for the client as possible.

How do I approach designing software?
I apparch software like I would any project. You have to treat it as an art project in a way by using critial thinking skills and program solving skills to understand the complexity of a problem and then be able to build a solution that overcomes this program.
